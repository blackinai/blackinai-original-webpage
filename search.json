Oral Research Presenters    Researcher Abstract     Bonolo Mathibel\nIBM Research Africa Towards Impactful Artificial Intelligence on the African Continent\nIn recent years, machine learning has been applied to solve diverse sets of challenges on the African continent. This includes reducing road traffic congestion in the face of failing road infrastructure in South Africa, drought modeling in the Horn of Africa, transfer learning for cassava disease detection in sub-Saharan Africa, and galaxy count extraction from radio telescopes. The vast majority of research conducted in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) occurs outside of the African continent, and the few studies that have been applied to the African context are based on bespoke datasets generated to solve the problem at hand. We therefore propose three pillars of representation that are foundational to achieving impactful, sustainable, and scalable AI research and product development for and on the African continent. Our aim is to increase the number of AI studies conducted in Africa and encourage researchers and AI practitioners to consider both science and impact when selecting problems to work on.   George W Musumba\nDedan Kimathi University of Technology Modelling Virtual Enterprises Using a Multi-Agent Systems Approach Nowadays enterprises work together towards a common goal by sharing responsibilities and profits as is the case for construction related projects. The construction sector’s potential contribution to the economic growth of developing countries can be enhanced if the challenges facing the sector that include delayed completion of projects, frequent collapse of buildings, lack of ethics, incompetent design, use of inappropriate materials, poor coordination and management of contractors are effectively addressed. These can be attributed to poor choice of partner enterprises for the tasks due to insufficient information available about them and lack of facilitation techniques. Selection of best partner among many for construction project is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. Existing MCDM techniques cannot be used to select right partners for construction projects. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Group Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (GFAHP), MCDM algorithms that learns partner attributes (machine learning technique incorporated), were designed and applied. A Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) approach was used for simulations. The approach provide efficient decision-making support for human beings using software agents. Results show that this technique is both efficient and effective. Validation of the system, carried out by stakeholders, show that it is approximately 99.7% accurate in the evaluation and selection of partners and partners\u0026rsquo;s performance evaluation.   Charles Onu\nMcGill University Saving Newborn Lives at Birth through Machine Learning Every year, 3 million newborns die within the first month of life. Birth asphyxia and other breathing-related conditions are a leading cause of mortality during the neonatal phase. Current diagnostic methods are too sophisticated in terms of equipment, required expertise, and general logistics. Consequently, early detection of asphyxia in newborns is very difficult in many parts of the world, especially in resource-poor settings. We are developing a machine learning system, dubbed Ubenwa, which enables diagnosis of asphyxia through automated analysis of the infant cry. Deployed via smartphone and wearable technology, Ubenwa will drastically reduce the time, cost and skill required to make accurate and potentially life-saving diagnoses.   Ousmane Dia\nElementAI Adversarial Functionality-Preserving Training in the Malware Domain Multiple approaches of generating adversarial examples have been proposed to deceive deep neural networks into predicting an incorrect target for a given observation [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10]. Most of the existing techniques that deal with images involve either computing the gradients of a loss function with respect to the images pixels [3, 7, 10], or they inject some noise generally sampled from a random or a normal distribution [1, 4, 8] into a true case in the hope that the network will take an unexpected decision. While for images, the adversarial examples are generated in a way to be identical to the true cases, the precise locations of some details in a true image may still not be preserved in the perturbed one [2]. However, exact locations of those fine details are not usually important for perceptual image recognition or validation due to images high-entropy [6]. In Security, and specifically in malware detection, however, where the cases in hand usually consist of raw bytes or sequences of system calls, this rarely holds. In Security, being able to generate new examples that preserve the functionalities (or malignant properties) of some true cases is paramount due to the difficulty of gathering large enough quantities of data for modeling purposes. We posit that the reasons the adversary generated examples may not preserve such properties are because the noise that is injected into the true cases is not necessarily sampled within the manifold of the true cases or that the gradients that are exploited are not selected in the neighborhood of the true examples.\nIn this study, we explore a new approach of generating adversarial malware cases. We make use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) (similar in spirit to [5]) to generate functionality-preserving mutations of true malware and extend Stein variational gradient descent [7] where the distribution of the latent samples are approximated using the true cases data-generating distribution. We also provide two ways to assess that the generated cases are functionality-preserving mutations of true malware: 1) by sampling sequences of bytes from the (vector representation of the) adversarial cases that we validate using as Oracle the Cuckoo Sandbox [9], and 2) by comparing specific sections of our generated mutations against true cases of malware. Because our architecture is generic enough, we evaluate our approach further with existing work on adversarial training of images and audio and compare our results.   Adji Bousso Dieng\nColumbia University A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency\nLanguage modeling is crucial to many NLP tasks. Applications include machine translation and speech recognition. Traditional n-gram and feed-forward neural network language models fail to capture long-range word dependencies. Previous work by Mikolov et al. has shown that adding context to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language model is a promising direction to solve this issue. In this talk I will briefly review traditional language models and topic models before diving into the more recent contextual RNN-based language models. In particular, I will discuss the TopicRNN model, a RNN-based language model that captures long-range semantic dependencies using topic features. I will also highlight some results on word prediction and sentiment analysis using the TopicRNN model.   Flora Ponjou Tasse\nUniversity of Cambridge ShapeSearch: A Generic Engine for 3D Models, Images, and Sketches\nWe present ShapeSearch, a generic search engine for shapes that supports queries such as 3D models, images, sketches, and text. Online repositories of images and 3D objects are growing at an exponential rate, used by growing communities of makers and artists. Moreover, the proliferation of Augmented Reality platforms is creating new communities of content creators and developers in need of 3D content. However, search features in the large 3D repositories are still limited to text. On the other hand, the research community has made significant progress in context-based shape retrieval, but current methods are typically limited to one modality such as images or sketches. We propose a generic search engine able to retrieve relevant shapes based on a wide range of modalities by leveraging the latest machine learning advances in Graphics, Vision, and NLP.

In existing interpretation methods for NLP, a word’s importance is determined by either input perturbation—measuring the decrease in model confidence when that word is removed—or by the gradient with respect to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these counterintuitive results, we draw connections to adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input reduction without accuracy loss on regular examples.\n Inioluwa Deborah Raji Title: \u0026ldquo;In the Shadow of Gender Shades\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: While there have been mounting calls for algorithmic transparency as more artificial intelligence services become mainstream, and audit approaches for online platforms have been proposed, audit strategies for the effective design and disclosure of external evaluations of commercial pretrained machine learning models distributed as Application Program Interfaces (APIs) remains underdeveloped. This paper thus extends scholarship on the development and impact of black-box algorithmic auditing by exploring a real-world commercial facial analysis intersectional audit and the corporate reactions to the audit release. This paper 1) outlines the audit design and the public and private audit disclosure procedure used in the Gender Shades study, 2) presents new performance metrics from originally targeted companies T-1, T-2, T-3 on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark as of August 2018, 3) provides performance results on PPB by non-target companies NT-A and NT-B and 4) Explores differences in company responses as shared through corporate communication.\n Justice Amoh Title: \u0026ldquo;An Optimized Recurrent Unit for Ultra-Low Power Acoustic Event Detection\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Currently, there is a demand for neural network models that can run on sensors, wearables and IoT devices. However, resource constraints of such edge devices make it challenging to realize on-device neural network inferencing. For ultra-low power wearable applications, there are no practical solutions for deploying neural networks. To meet this need, our work introduces a new recurrent unit architecture that is specifically adapted for on-device low-power acoustic event detection (AED). The proposed embedded Gated Recurrent Unit (eGRU) is based on the GRU architecture but features optimizations that make it implementable on ultra-low power micro-controllers such as the ARM Cortex M0+. With our proposed modifications, eGRU is demonstrated to be effective, especially for short duration AED and keyword spotting tasks. A single eGRU cell is 60x faster and 12x smaller than a GRU cell. Despite its optimizations, eGRU compares well with conventional GRU across AED tasks of different complexities.\n Kehinde Owoeye Title: \u0026ldquo;Identifying sheep with abnormal movement trajectory in a flock\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Learning to identify anomalies in the behavior of individuals is becoming increasingly important for a variety of reasons for example in studying the progression of several diseases. Due to the need to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, animals with longer life span are becoming increasingly important for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. In this presentation, I will describe computational methods that allow for the automatic discrimination of sheep with a genetic mutation that causes Batten disease from an age-matched control group, using GPS movement traces as input. Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms that are likely to affect the way that those with it move and socialize, including loss of vision and dementia. The distance covered in each ten minute period and, more specifically, outliers in each period, are used as the basis for identification. Our results show that, despite the variability in the sample, the bulk of the outliers during the period of observation came from the sheep with Batten disease. Our results, though preliminary, point towards the potential of using relatively simple movement metrics in identifying the onset of a phenotype in symptomatically similar conditions.\n Lucio Dery Title: \u0026ldquo;Audio to Body Dynamics\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: We present a method that gets as input an audio of violin or piano playing, and outputs a video of skeleton predictions which are further used to animate an avatar. The key idea is to create an animation of an avatar that moves their hands similarly to how a pianist or violinist would do, just from audio. Aiming for a fully detailed correct arms and fingers motion is a goal, however, it’s not clear if body movement can be predicted from music at all. In this paper, we present the first result that shows that natural body dynamics can be predicted at all. We built an LSTM network that is trained on violin and piano recital videos uploaded to the Internet. The predicted points are applied onto a rigged avatar to create the animation.\n Obioma Pelka Title: \u0026ldquo;Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO): A Multimodal Medical Image Dataset\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: This work introduces a new multimodal image dataset, with the aim of detecting the interplay between visual elements and semantic relations present in radiology images. The objective is accomplished by retrieving all image-caption pairs from the open-access biomedical literature database PubMedCentral, as these captions describe the visual content in their semantic context. The target domain being radiology, all compound, multi-pane, and non-radiology images were eliminated using an automatic binary classifier fine-tuned with a deep convolutional neural network system and trained with datasets distributed at the medical tasks of ImageCLEF 2013, 2015 and 2016. The Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset contains over 81k radiology images with several medical imaging modalities including Computer Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, X-Ray, Fluoroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Mammography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Angiography and PET-CT. For all images in ROCO, the corresponding caption, keywords, Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and Semantic Type will be distributed. An additional out-of-class set with 6k images ranging from synthetic radiology figures to digital arts is provided, to improve prediction and classification performance of out-of-class samples. Adopting ROCO, systems for caption and keywords generation can be modeled, which enables multimodal representation for image datasets lacking text representation. Furthermore, systems with the goal of image structuring and semantic information tagging can be created using ROCO, which is beneficial and of assistance for image and information retrieval purposes.\n Raesetje Sefala Title: \u0026ldquo;Using satellite images and computer vision to study the evolution and effects of spatial apartheid in South Africa\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: One of the main problems in South Africa is removing many of the legacies of Apartheid - a former policy of economic and political discrimination, and segregation against non-European groups in South Africa. For example, moving around residential areas shows the legacy of spatial apartheid on a smaller scale- completely segregated neighborhoods of townships next to gated wealthy neighborhoods that have largely remained unaffected by the ending of apartheid. Our research proposes to use computer vision to analyze millions of such satellite images of South Africa from 2006 to 2016. This work aims to use satellite images, geographically labelled coordinates of South Africa\u0026rsquo;s built environment and socioeconomic data to understand the relationship between the spatial and socioeconomic makeup of neighborhoods in South Africa, and study how they have evolved over time post Apartheid. We propose a semantic segmentation model to detect and classify clusters of townships and wealthy areas from these high resolution satellite images. In addition to automatically detecting and classifying neighborhoods, we plan to use demographic and socioeconomic data to then analyze the change over time in the demographic makeup, economic status and access to basic resources such as the number of clinics and schools of these detected neighborhoods.\n Randi Williams Title: \u0026ldquo;PopBots: Leveraging Social Robots to Aid Early Childhood Artificial Intelligence Education\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing our lives, impacting the way that even the youngest members of society live, learn, and play. Previous work examining children’s relationships with AI has shown that this population lacks an understanding of how AI devices work. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for children to engage in safe and constructive interactions with their smart playthings. Furthermore, as this technology becomes more pervasive, we must think about how to build a diverse workforce that creates technology to equitably address the needs of many. Given these motivations, we designed an early childhood AI curriculum, PopBots. PopBots is a hands-on toolkit that enables young children to learn about AI by programming and training a social robot. We evaluated the toolkit with 80 preschool children (ages 4-6) and found that the use of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was effective. Children could correctly answer questions about knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative music algorithms. Additionally, we found that using the toolkit helped children better appreciate the cognitive capabilities of robots. We will discuss the toolkit and teaching methods used in hope that this first exploration into early AI education will inspire other educators and researchers.\n Sicelukwanda Zwane Title: \u0026ldquo;Safer Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning using Action Priors\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Behavior learning in deep reinforcement learning is inherently unsafe because untrained agents typically have to sample actions from randomly initialized task policies and from random exploration policies. Executing these actions in physical environments can lead agents to harmful states, possibly causing damage and poor initial performance. In this work, we address this problem by using transfer learning to develop a framework for safer reinforcement learning in continuous environments. We show that our exploration policy results in fewer collisions with the environment, better initial performance, and earlier convergence compared to the vanilla epsilon-greedy random exploration policy.\n Tewodros Abebe Gebreselassie Title: \u0026ldquo;Parallel Corpora for bi-Directional Statistical Machine Translation for Seven Ethiopian Language Pairs\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian Languages: Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Ge’ez. To check the usability of all the corpora we used them to conduct a baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation experiment for seven language pairs. The bi-directional SMT BLEU score shows that all the corpora can be used for further SMT investigations. We have also learnt that the morphological richness of the Ethio-Semitic languages has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially when they are target languages. Now we are working towards selecting an optimal alignment for bi-directional statistical machine translation among the Ethiopian languages.\nAccepted Posters (Accepted posters will be added soon)\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543290022,"objectID":"0654711257ded6c59b8f4315e9be266c","permalink":"https://esube.github.io/workshop/2018/programs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2018/programs/","section":"workshop","summary":"Schedule 2018    Time Event Speaker Institution     09:00-09:10 Opening Remarks  BAI   09:10-09:45 Keynote 1 Yann Dauphin Facebook   09:45-10:00 Oral 1 Sicelukwanda Zwane University of the Witwatersrand   10:00-10:15 Oral 2 Alvin Grissom II Ursinus College   10:15-10:30 Oral 3 Obioma Pelka University of Duisburg-Essen Germany   10:30-11:00 Coffee Break + poster     11:00-11:35 Keynote 2 Ayanna Howard Georgia Institute of Technology   11:35-11:50 Oral 4 Randi Williams MIT Media Lab   11:50-12:05 Oral 5 Justice Amoh Dartmouth College   12:05-12:20 Oral 6 Kehinde Owoeye University College London   12:20-02:00 Lunch + Poster     02:00-02:15 Oral 7 Lucio Dery Facebook Inc.","tags":null,"title":"Programs 2018","type":"workshop"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Thanks to our corporate sponsors, the workshop is free to attendees and we are able to provide inclusive travel funding to select participants.\n Platinum Sponsors (Black Power in AI) \r-- \r## Gold Sponsors -- \r\r Gold Sponsors (System) \r-- \r Silver Sponsors (Component) \r-- \r\r\r\r Supporters We thank B4 Capital Group for their support We also thank the following institutions for sponsoring their students to attend the workshop\n Cornell University Duke University Harvard University Stanford University University of California, Berkeley University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542063322,"objectID":"9b64b15c2070cfe8766971bce44ca92a","permalink":"https://esube.github.io/workshop/2017/sponsors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2017/sponsors/","section":"workshop","summary":"Thanks to our corporate sponsors, the workshop is free to attendees and we are able to provide inclusive travel funding to select participants.\n Platinum Sponsors (Black Power in AI) \r-- \r## Gold Sponsors -- \r\r Gold Sponsors (System) \r-- \r Silver Sponsors (Component) \r-- \r\r\r\r Supporters We thank B4 Capital Group for their support We also thank the following institutions for sponsoring their students to attend the workshop","tags":null,"title":"Sponsors 2017","type":"workshop"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Thanks to our corporate sponsors, the workshop is free to attendees and we are able to provide inclusive travel funding to select participants.\n Diamond Sponsors \r-- \r\r\r\r Platinum Sponsors \r\r\r\r\r Gold Sponsors  \r\r\r Silver Sponsors \r\r\r  \r\r-- We thank the following companies and institutions for their support.\n Airbnb Kaggle MILA   We also thank the following institutions for sponsoring their students to attend the workshop\n Berkley University Cornell University Duke University Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) Harvard University Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) McGill University Northwestern University Rutgers University Stanford University, Computer Science Stanford University, Stats University of California, Berkeley University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign University of Montreal, Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA)  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512686,"objectID":"ad605bd105b1bc7784ae7e5721ce5d96","permalink":"https://esube.github.io/workshop/2018/sponsors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/2018/sponsors/","section":"workshop","summary":"Thanks to our corporate sponsors, the workshop is free to attendees and we are able to provide inclusive travel funding to select participants.\n Diamond Sponsors \r-- \r\r\r\r Platinum Sponsors \r\r\r\r\r Gold Sponsors  \r\r\r Silver Sponsors \r\r\r  \r\r-- We thank the following companies and institutions for their support.\n Airbnb Kaggle MILA   We also thank the following institutions for sponsoring their students to attend the workshop","tags":null,"title":"Sponsors 2018","type":"workshop"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We welcome theoretical, empirical, and applied work in machine learning and artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, search, planning, knowledge representation, reasoning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, multiagent systems, statistical reasoning, and deep learning.
