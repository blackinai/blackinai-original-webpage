<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Pathologies of Neural Models Make Interpretations Difficult&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: One way to interpret neural model predictions
is to highlight the most important input
features—for example, a heatmap visualization
over the words in an input sentence.
In existing interpretation methods for
NLP, a word’s importance is determined by
either input perturbation—measuring the decrease
in model confidence when that word is
removed—or by the gradient with respect to
that word. To understand the limitations of
these methods, we use input reduction, which
iteratively removes the least important word
from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors
of neural models: the remaining words
appear nonsensical to humans and are not the
ones determined as important by interpretation
methods. As we confirm with human experiments,
the reduced examples lack information
to support the prediction of any label,
but models still make the same predictions
with high confidence. To explain these
counterintuitive results, we draw connections
to adversarial examples and confidence calibration:
pathological behaviors reveal difficulties
in interpreting neural models trained with
maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies,
we fine-tune the models by encouraging
high entropy outputs on reduced examples.
Fine-tuned models become more interpretable
under input reduction without accuracy loss on
regular examples.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;In the Shadow of Gender Shades&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: While there have been mounting calls for algorithmic transparency as more artificial intelligence services become mainstream, and audit
approaches for online platforms have been proposed, audit
strategies for the effective design and disclosure of external evaluations
of commercial pretrained machine learning models distributed
as Application Program Interfaces (APIs) remains underdeveloped.
This paper thus extends scholarship on the development and impact
of black-box algorithmic auditing by exploring a real-world
commercial facial analysis intersectional audit and the corporate
reactions to the audit release. This paper 1) outlines the audit design and the public and private audit disclosure procedure used in the Gender Shades study, 2) presents new performance metrics from originally targeted companies T-1, T-2, T-3 on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark as of August
2018, 3) provides performance results on PPB by non-target companies
NT-A and NT-B and 4) Explores differences in company
responses as shared through corporate communication.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;An Optimized Recurrent Unit for Ultra-Low Power Acoustic Event Detection&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Currently, there is a demand for neural network models that can run on sensors, wearables and IoT devices. However, resource constraints of such edge devices make it challenging to realize on-device neural network inferencing. For ultra-low power wearable applications, there are no practical solutions for deploying neural networks. To meet this need, our work introduces a new recurrent unit architecture that is specifically adapted for on-device low-power acoustic event detection (AED). The proposed embedded Gated Recurrent Unit (eGRU) is based on the GRU architecture but features optimizations that make it implementable on ultra-low power micro-controllers such as the ARM Cortex M0+. With our proposed modifications, eGRU is demonstrated to be effective, especially for short duration AED and keyword spotting tasks. A single eGRU cell is 60x faster and 12x smaller than a GRU cell. Despite its optimizations, eGRU compares well with conventional GRU across AED tasks of different complexities.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Identifying sheep with abnormal movement trajectory in a flock&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Learning to identify anomalies in the behavior of individuals is becoming increasingly important for a variety of reasons for example in studying the progression of several diseases. Due to the need to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, animals with longer life span are becoming increasingly important for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. In this presentation, I will describe computational methods that allow for the automatic discrimination of sheep with a genetic mutation that causes Batten disease from an age-matched control group, using GPS movement traces as input. Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms that are likely to affect the way that those with it move and socialize, including loss of vision and dementia. The distance covered in each ten minute period and, more specifically, outliers in each period, are used as the basis for identification. Our results show that, despite the variability in the sample, the bulk of the outliers during the period of observation came from the sheep with Batten disease. Our results, though preliminary, point towards the potential of using relatively simple movement metrics in identifying the onset of a phenotype in symptomatically similar conditions.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Audio to Body Dynamics&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: We present a method that gets as input an audio of violin
or piano playing, and outputs a video of skeleton predictions
which are further used to animate an avatar. The
key idea is to create an animation of an avatar that moves
their hands similarly to how a pianist or violinist would do,
just from audio. Aiming for a fully detailed correct arms
and fingers motion is a goal, however, it’s not clear if body
movement can be predicted from music at all. In this paper,
we present the first result that shows that natural body dynamics
can be predicted at all. We built an LSTM network
that is trained on violin and piano recital videos uploaded to
the Internet. The predicted points are applied onto a rigged
avatar to create the animation.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO): A Multimodal Medical Image Dataset&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: This work introduces a new multimodal image dataset, with the aim of detecting the interplay between visual elements and semantic relations present in radiology images. The objective is accomplished by retrieving all image-caption pairs from the open-access biomedical literature database PubMedCentral, as these captions describe the visual content in their semantic context. The target domain being radiology, all compound, multi-pane, and non-radiology images were eliminated using an automatic binary classifier fine-tuned with a deep convolutional neural network system and trained with datasets distributed at the medical tasks of ImageCLEF 2013, 2015 and 2016. The Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset contains over 81k radiology images with several medical imaging modalities including Computer Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, X-Ray, Fluoroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Mammography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Angiography and PET-CT. For all images in ROCO, the corresponding caption, keywords, Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and Semantic Type will be distributed. An additional out-of-class set with 6k images ranging from synthetic radiology figures to digital arts is provided, to improve prediction and classification performance of out-of-class samples. Adopting ROCO, systems for caption and keywords generation can be modeled, which enables multimodal representation for image datasets lacking text representation. Furthermore, systems with the goal of image structuring and semantic information tagging can be created using ROCO, which is beneficial and of assistance for image and information retrieval purposes.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Using satellite images and computer vision to study the evolution and effects of spatial apartheid in South Africa&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: One of the main problems in South Africa is removing many of the legacies of Apartheid - a former policy of economic and political discrimination, and segregation against non-European groups in South Africa. For example, moving around residential areas shows the legacy of spatial apartheid on a smaller scale- completely segregated neighborhoods of townships next to gated wealthy neighborhoods that have largely remained unaffected by the ending of apartheid. Our research proposes to use computer vision to analyze millions of such satellite images of South Africa from 2006 to 2016. This work aims to use satellite images, geographically labelled coordinates of South Africa&rsquo;s built environment and socioeconomic data to understand the relationship between the spatial and socioeconomic makeup of neighborhoods in South Africa, and study how they have evolved over time post Apartheid. We propose a semantic segmentation model to detect and classify clusters of townships and wealthy areas from these high resolution satellite images. In addition to automatically detecting and classifying neighborhoods, we plan to use demographic and socioeconomic data to then analyze the change over time in the demographic makeup, economic status and access to basic resources such as the number of clinics and schools of these detected neighborhoods.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;PopBots: Leveraging Social Robots to Aid Early Childhood Artificial Intelligence Education&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing our lives, impacting the way that even the youngest members of society live, learn, and play. Previous work examining children’s relationships with AI has shown that this population lacks an understanding of how AI devices work. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for children to engage in safe and constructive interactions with their smart playthings. Furthermore, as this technology becomes more pervasive, we must think about how to build a diverse workforce that creates technology to equitably address the needs of many. Given these motivations, we designed an early childhood AI curriculum, PopBots. PopBots is a hands-on toolkit that enables young children to learn about AI by programming and training a social robot. We evaluated the toolkit with 80 preschool children (ages 4-6) and found that the use of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was effective. Children could correctly answer questions about knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative music algorithms. Additionally, we found that using the toolkit helped children better appreciate the cognitive capabilities of robots. We will discuss the toolkit and teaching methods used in hope that this first exploration into early AI education will inspire other educators and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Safer Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning using Action Priors&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Behavior learning in deep reinforcement learning is inherently unsafe because untrained agents typically have to sample actions from randomly initialized task policies and from random exploration policies. Executing these actions in physical environments can lead agents to harmful states, possibly causing damage and poor initial performance. In this work, we address this problem by using transfer learning to develop a framework for safer reinforcement learning in continuous environments. We show that our exploration policy results in fewer collisions with the environment, better initial performance, and earlier convergence compared to the vanilla epsilon-greedy random exploration policy.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: &ldquo;Parallel Corpora for bi-Directional Statistical Machine Translation for Seven Ethiopian Language Pairs&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian Languages: Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Ge’ez. To check the usability of all the corpora we used them to conduct a baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation experiment for seven language pairs. The bi-directional SMT BLEU score shows that all the corpora can be used for further SMT investigations. We have also learnt that the morphological richness of the Ethio-Semitic languages has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially when they are target languages. Now we are working towards selecting an optimal alignment for bi-directional statistical machine translation among the Ethiopian languages.</p>
