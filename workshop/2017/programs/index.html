<td><em>Towards Impactful Artificial Intelligence on the African Continent</em><br>In recent years, machine learning has been applied to solve diverse sets of challenges on the African continent. This includes reducing road traffic congestion in the face of failing road infrastructure in South Africa, drought modeling in the Horn of Africa, transfer learning for cassava disease detection in sub-Saharan Africa, and galaxy count extraction from radio telescopes. The vast majority of research conducted in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) occurs outside of the African continent, and the few studies that have been applied to the African context are based on bespoke datasets generated to solve the problem at hand. We therefore propose three pillars of representation that are foundational to achieving impactful, sustainable, and scalable AI research and product development for and on the African continent. Our aim is to increase the number of AI studies conducted in Africa and encourage researchers and AI practitioners to consider both science and impact when selecting problems to work on.</td>

<td><em>Modelling Virtual Enterprises Using a Multi-Agent Systems Approach</em> <br> Nowadays enterprises work together towards a common goal by sharing responsibilities and profits as is the case for construction related projects. The construction sector’s potential contribution to the economic growth of developing countries can be enhanced if the challenges facing the sector that include delayed completion of projects, frequent collapse of buildings, lack of ethics, incompetent design, use of inappropriate materials, poor coordination and management of contractors are effectively addressed. These can be attributed to poor choice of partner enterprises for the tasks due to insufficient information available about them and lack of facilitation techniques. Selection of best partner among many for construction project is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. Existing MCDM techniques cannot be used to select right partners for construction projects. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Group Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (GFAHP), MCDM algorithms that learns partner attributes (machine learning technique incorporated), were designed and applied. A Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) approach was used for simulations. The approach provide efficient decision-making support for human beings using software agents. Results show that this technique is both efficient and effective. Validation of the system, carried out by stakeholders, show that it is approximately 99.7% accurate in the evaluation and selection of partners and partners&rsquo;s performance evaluation.</td>

<td><em>Saving Newborn Lives at Birth through Machine Learning</em> <br>Every year, 3 million newborns die within the first month of life. Birth asphyxia and other breathing-related conditions are a leading cause of mortality during the neonatal phase. Current diagnostic methods are too sophisticated in terms of equipment, required expertise, and general logistics. Consequently, early detection of asphyxia in newborns is very difficult in many parts of the world, especially in resource-poor settings. We are developing a machine learning system, dubbed Ubenwa, which enables diagnosis of asphyxia through automated analysis of the infant cry. Deployed via smartphone and wearable technology, Ubenwa will drastically reduce the time, cost and skill required to make accurate and potentially life-saving diagnoses.</td>

<td><em>Adversarial Functionality-Preserving Training in the Malware Domain</em> <br>Multiple approaches of generating adversarial examples have been proposed to deceive deep neural networks into predicting an incorrect target for a given observation [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10]. Most of the existing techniques that deal with images involve either computing the gradients of a loss function with respect to the images pixels [3, 7, 10], or they inject some noise generally sampled from a random or a normal distribution [1, 4, 8] into a true case in the hope that the network will take an unexpected decision. While for images, the adversarial examples are generated in a way to be identical to the true cases, the precise locations of some details in a true image may still not be preserved in the perturbed one [2]. However, exact locations of those fine details are not usually important for perceptual image recognition or validation due to images high-entropy [6]. In Security, and specifically in malware detection, however, where the cases in hand usually consist of raw bytes or sequences of system calls, this rarely holds. In Security, being able to generate new examples that preserve the functionalities (or malignant properties) of some true cases is paramount due to the difficulty of gathering large enough quantities of data for modeling purposes. We posit that the reasons the adversary generated examples may not preserve such properties are because the noise that is injected into the true cases is not necessarily sampled within the manifold of the true cases or that the gradients that are exploited are not selected in the neighborhood of the true examples.<br>In this study, we explore a new approach of generating adversarial malware cases. We make use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) (similar in spirit to [5]) to generate functionality-preserving mutations of true malware and extend Stein variational gradient descent [7] where the distribution of the latent samples are approximated using the true cases data-generating distribution. We also provide two ways to assess that the generated cases are functionality-preserving mutations of true malware: 1) by sampling sequences of bytes from the (vector representation of the) adversarial cases that we validate using as Oracle the Cuckoo Sandbox [9], and 2) by comparing specific sections of our generated mutations against true cases of malware. Because our architecture is generic enough, we evaluate our approach further with existing work on adversarial training of images and audio and compare our results.</td>

<td><em>A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency</em><br> Language modeling is crucial to many NLP tasks. Applications include machine translation and speech recognition. Traditional n-gram and feed-forward neural network language models fail to capture long-range word dependencies. Previous work by Mikolov et al. has shown that adding context to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language model is a promising direction to solve this issue. In this talk I will briefly review traditional language models and topic models before diving into the more recent contextual RNN-based language models. In particular, I will discuss the TopicRNN model, a RNN-based language model that captures long-range semantic dependencies using topic features. I will also highlight some results on word prediction and sentiment analysis using the TopicRNN model.</td>

<td><em>ShapeSearch: A Generic Engine for 3D Models, Images, and Sketches</em><br>We present ShapeSearch, a generic search engine for shapes that supports queries such as 3D models, images, sketches, and text. Online repositories of images and 3D objects are growing at an exponential rate, used by growing communities of makers and artists. Moreover, the proliferation of Augmented Reality platforms is creating new communities of content creators and developers in need of 3D content. However, search features in the large 3D repositories are still limited to text. On the other hand, the research community has made significant progress in context-based shape retrieval, but current methods are typically limited to one modality such as images or sketches. We propose a generic search engine able to retrieve relevant shapes based on a wide range of modalities by leveraging the latest machine learning advances in Graphics, Vision, and NLP.</td>
