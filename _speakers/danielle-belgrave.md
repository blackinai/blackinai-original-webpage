Danielle Belgrave is a Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge. She also holds a tenured Research Fellowship (Assistant Professor) at Imperial College London. Her research focuses on developing probabilistic and causal graphical modelling frameworks to understand disease progression over time. The aim of this research is to use machine learning to identify distinct subtypes of disease evolution (endotypes) and to understand the underlying mechanisms of these subtypes so as to develop personalized disease management strategies. She has a BSc in Business Mathematics and Statistics from the London School of Economics and an MSc in Statistics from University College London. She was awarded a Microsoft PhD Scholarship to complete her PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning applied to Health (2010-2013) at The University of Manchester.  She received a Medical Research Council (UK) Career Development Award in Biostatistics (2015 – 2020) for the project “Unified probabilistic latent variable modelling strategies to accelerate endotype discovery in longitudinal studies”.
