Dr Simon Osindero is a pioneer in the field of machine learning. His 2006
post-doctoral research on deep belief networks in collaboration with Geoff Hinton
and Yee Whye Teh helped kickstart the deep learning revolution.  
He is currently a scientist at DeepMind, where he researches machine learning
methods with the goal of developing Artificial General Intelligence. In his previous
role as an A.I. Architect at Yahoo, he led computer vision and machine learning
R&D at Flickr. He joined Yahoo in 2013 after it acquired LookFlow, a company he
cofounded in 2009 to productize cutting-edge research from the fields of machine
learning and human-computer interaction. Prior to starting LookFlow, he worked
with a Montreal-based start-up, Idilia, designing machine learning algorithms for
natural language processing.  
He holds a MSci in physics and a BA/MA in natural sciences (physics, biochemistry,
molecular biology, mathematics) from Cambridge University (1st Class) and a PhD
in Computational Neuroscience from the Gatsby Unit, University College London. He
has also worked as a visual and new-media artist, and holds degrees in Photography
and Digital Design from Concordia University.
