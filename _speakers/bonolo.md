__Title__:Towards Impactful Artificial Intelligence on the African Continent
<br><br>
__Abstract__: In recent years, machine learning has been applied to solve diverse sets of challenges on the African continent. This includes reducing road traffic congestion in the face of failing road infrastructure in South Africa, drought modeling in the Horn of Africa, transfer learning for cassava disease detection in sub-Saharan Africa, and galaxy count extraction from radio telescopes. The vast majority of research conducted in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) occurs outside of the African continent, and the few studies that have been applied to the African context are based on bespoke datasets generated to solve the problem at hand. We therefore propose three pillars of representation that are foundational to achieving impactful, sustainable, and scalable AI research and product development for and on the African continent. Our aim is to increase the number of AI studies conducted in Africa and encourage researchers and AI practitioners to consider both science and impact when selecting problems to work on.
