Debo is co-founder and CTO of [Gigster](https://gigster.com/), a software development marketplace that seeks to automate the creation and delivery of software while creating a productive workplace of the future for engineers. Gigster logs data about code, projects, and people throughout the software development lifecycle and uses patterns in that data to drive increases in reliability and efficiency. Gigster aims to apply machine learning to challenging problems like software cost and time estimation, optimal team formation, predicting the future (risk) on projects, and ultimately code generation.  Gigster is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint, Y Combinator, and Greylock.  
Debo has founded multiple marketplace, energy, and data startups. He is on leave from a physics PhD at Cornell where he worked on silicon nanophotonics and theoretical physics. He was once a radio featured musician and was the young Nigerian scientist of 2011. Debo advises startups and helps young founders as a Thiel Fellowship mentor.
