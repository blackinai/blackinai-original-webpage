# Workshop at NIPS 2017

The first Black in AI event will be co-located with [NIPS 2017](https://nips.cc/) in the __Pike Ballroom__ at the [Renaissance Long Beach Hotel](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lgbrn-renaissance-long-beach-hotel)  in Long Beach, California on December 8th from 1:00pm to 6:00pm. The poster session will be held at the __Broadlind 2__ room on the second floor of the Renaissance hotel. The workshop will be followed by dinner 6:30-8:30. We invite Black AI researchers from around the world to share their work and learn about others’ research. The workshop will have invited talks from prominent researchers, oral presentations, and a poster session. There will also be socials to facilitate networking, discussion of different career opportunities in AI, and sharing of ideas to increase participation of Black researchers in the field. We invite all Black researchers, including undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and researchers in industry to participate in this workshop. People of all races are also invited to attend the workshop to learn about the research being conducted by Black researchers across the world. Deadline for registration is October 31, 2017 and can done [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxDyUB0z--LwPNfK9ypOmNPMHf2wc51DuqSvituMtD53mGbA/viewform).
