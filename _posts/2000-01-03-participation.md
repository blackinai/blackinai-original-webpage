## Travel Awards
Need-based travel grants will be awarded to workshop participants. The travel grant can be used for covering costs associated with the workshop such as NIPS registration, accommodation and travel. Please note that the travel grants may not cover all of your costs and we may not be able to award them to all applicants. The amount of money we award to each person will depend on the number of applicants and the location each applicant will be traveling from.

If you are a student who has not conducted research and would like a travel grant to attend our workshop, you may do so by either:

 1. Submitting an abstract, and a paragraph describing financial need on the conference submission page OR
 2. Submitting a one page statement describing your research interests in AI and reasons for participating in the workshop, and a paragraph describing financial need on the conference submission page

These must be done by the deadline, _October 13, 2017_.
